                                <p>The Internet is a network made up of hundreds of millions of interconected devices referred to as
																<strong>hosts</strong> (also referred to as <strong>end-systems</strong>.)
																They are referred to as end systems because they sit at the edge of the Internet, and they are referred to as hosts because
																they host applications such as a Web browser program, a Web server program, or an e-mail server program.</p>

																<p><strong>End-systems</strong> are connected by <strong>communication links</strong> (physical media like coaxil cable,
																copper wire, optical fiber and radio spectrums) and <a href="#" onclick="$('#section-3').animatescroll();"><strong>packet-switches.</strong></a></p>

																<p>The <strong>access network</strong> is the network that physically connects an end-system to <strong>the first router</strong>
																	(aka <strong>the edge router</strong>) on the path from the end system to any distant system. </p>

															<h1>Packet Switches</h1>

															<p>When one end-system has to send data to another end-system, the sending system segments the data and adds <strong>header bytes</strong>
																 to each segment. The resulting packages of information (packets) are sent through the network to the end system,
															 where they are reassembled into the original data.</p>

															 <p>The header of each packet contains the IP address. This works like a postal system. A packet arrives at a router in the network and the
																 router, the router examines a portion of the packet's destination address and forwards the packet to an adjacent router. It does this with
																 the use of a <strong>forwarding table</strong> that maps portions of the desination address to one of that router's outbound links.<br>
															 The Internet has a number of special <strong> routing protocols</strong> that are used to automatically set the forwarding tables.</p>



																<p>A <strong>packet switch</strong> takes a package that's arriving into an incoming communication link, and forwards it
																to an outgoing communication link.</p>

																<p>The two most prominent types of packet switches are <strong> routers </strong> and <strong> link-layer switches</strong>.</p>

																<p>Routers are typically used in the network's <strong>core.</strong> </p>

																<p>Link-layer switches are typically used to <strong>access networks</strong>. </p>

																<p>The series of communication links and package switches that a packet goes through on its way from a sending
																	to recieving system is typically called a <strong>route</strong> or <strong>path</strong>.</p>

																	<p>Packages are transmitted to each communication link at <strong>a rate equal to the full transmission rate of the link</strong>.
																		So if a source end-system or packet-switch is sending a packet of L bits over a link with a transmission rate of
																		R bits/sec, then the time to trasmit the package is L/R seconds. </p>

																		<p>Most packet switches use <strong>store-and-forward transmission</strong> at the inputs to the link. This means that the
																			packet-switch <strong>must receive the entire packet</strong> before it can begin to <strong>transfer the first bit of the packet into
																			the outbound link</strong>.</p>

																			<p> Now, let's calculate the time that a system using the store-and-forward method needs to forward three packets
																				from a source, to a router, to a destination.<br>
																				<ul>
																				<li>Step 1: packet1 ----> router = L/R seconds</li>
																				<li>Step 2: packet2 ----> router and packet1 --->destination = L/R seconds</li>
																				<li>Step 3: packet3 ----> router and packet2 --->destination = L/R seconds</li>
																				<li>Step 4: packet3 ---> destination = L/R seconds</li>
																			</ul>
																			Total time: 4L/R seconds.

																		</p>

																		<p>Another important formula, relevance unclear: <br>
																				Where:
																				<ul>
																					<li> L = Bits</li>
																					<li> R = Rate (in bits/sec) </li>
																					<li> N = number of links each at rate R</li>

																				</ul>

																				The end-to-end delay = N*(L/R)<br>
																				<strong>d<sub>end-to-end</sub> = N (L/R)</strong>

                                <h1>ISPs</h1>

																<p>End systems access the Internet through <strong>Internet Service Providers (ISPs)</strong>. </p>

																<p>Each ISP is in itself a network of packet switches and communication links. ISPs provide Internet access to both
																users and content-providers, connecting websites directly to the Internet.</p>

																<p>Lower-tier ISPs are connected through national and international
																	upper-tier ISPs, such as Level 3 Communications, AT&T, Sprint, and NTT. An upper-tier ISP consists of a high-speed router
																interconnected with high-speed fiber-optic links.</p>

																<p>End-systems, packet-switches and more run <strong>protocols</strong> that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet.</p>
																<p>Two important protocols:</p>
																<ul>
																		<li>The <strong>Transmission Control Protocol(TCP)</strong></li>
																		<li>The <strong>Internet Protocol (IP)</strong> </li>
																</ul>

																<p>Together, these are known as TC/IP.</p>

																<p><strong>Internet Standards</strong> are developed by the <strong>Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</strong>.
																	The IETF standards documetns are called <strong>requests for comments (RFCs)</strong>. RFCs define protocols such as
																	TCP, IP, HTTP (for web), and SMTP (for email). There are currently more than 6,000 RFCs.

																</p>

																<p>The IEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee specifies the Ethernet and wireless WiFi standards.</p>

																<p>Services like electonric mail, web surfing, social networks, instant messeging, video streaming, P2P file sharing, etc.
																are said to be <strong>distributed applications.</strong> This is because they involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each
															other. Internet applications <strong>run on end systems--</strong> they do not run in the packet switches in the network core.

														Although packet switches facilitate the exchange of data among end systems, <strong>they are not concerned with the application that is the source or sink of the data.</strong> </p>

																								<p><strong>Output Queue:</strong> Stores packets that are the router is about to send into the link that it refers to.</p>
																								<p> If a link is busy with the transmission of a packet, and another packet arrives there, it must wait in the output buffer. This is a <strong>queing delay.</strong>

																								If the finite buffer space is <strong> full</strong>, packet-loss will occur: either the arriving packet or one in the queue is <strong>dropped.</strong></p>

																		<h1>Circuit Switching</h1>
																		<p>In circuit-switched networks, the resources needed along a path to provide for
																			 communication between the end systems are <strong>reserved</strong> for the duration of the communication session between the end systems.<br>
																			 In packet-switched networks, these resources are <strong>not</strong> reserved. The circuit-switched network is like a resturaunt that requires reservations,
																		  and the packet-switched network is like one that doesn't: in the packet-switched network, you have to deal with queing delays and whatnot, but in the circuit-switched
																		network you have to order in advanced. </p>

																		<p> An example of a circuit switched network is a traditional telephone network. A connection (a <strong>circuit</strong> in telephony jargon) between two users must be established between the sender
																			and reciever, for which the switches on the path maintain connection state for that connection. The network reserves a constant transmission rate in the network's links
																			for the duration of the connection. Therefor the sender can transfer the data to the receiver at a <strong>gaurenteed</strong> constant rate.</p>
																			<p>A circuit in a link is implemented with either frequency-division multiplexing or time-division multiplexing.

																				<ul>
																					<li><strong>Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM):</strong>
																						For the duration of the connection, a link dedicates a frequency band to each connection. The width of the band is called the bandwidth. "the frequency spectrum of a link is divided up among the connections established across the link."</li>
																					<li><strong>Time-division multiplixing (TDM):</strong> Time is divided into frames of a fixed duration, and each frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots.
																					Across a link, a connection dedicates one timeslot per frame.</li>
																				</ul>

																				<p> Math: </p>
																				<p> For TDM, the transmission rate of a circuit is equal to the frame rate multiplied by the number of bits in a slot. Example: If a link trasmits 8,000 frames
																					per second and each slot consists of 8 bits, the transmission rate of a circuit is 64 kbps.</p>

																				<p> Another problem: We want to send a file of <strong>640,000 bits</strong> from Host A to Host B over a circuit-switched network, and all the links in the network use <strong>TDM with 24 slots</strong> and <strong>have a bit rate
																					of 1.563 Mbps</strong>, and it takes <strong> 500 msec</strong> to establish an end-to-end circuit before Host A can begin to transmit the file. How long does it take to send the file?



																				<ul>
																					<li>Step 1) Calculate transmission rate of a circuit (remember that the network dedicates just 1 timeslot per frame): (1.536 Mbps)/24 slots = 64 kbps (there are 1,000 kb in 1 mb)</li>
																						<li> Step 2) Divide the size of the file by the transmission rate: 640,000 bits/64 kbps = 10 seconds (there are 1000 bytes in 1 kb, so it's 640 k bits/ 64 k bitsPerSeconds = 10 secs)</li>
																							<li> Step 3) Add the 500 mscec = 1/2 seconds. So the total time is 10.5 seconds. <strong> The transmission time is indpendant of the number of links: it would be 10 seconds whether it were 1 or 100 links.</strong></li>
																					<ul>
